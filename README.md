# Point Gamma Radiation Dose 

This repo was made to demonstrate how to calculate gamma radiation *absorbed dose* emitted from *point source*. Various material gamma-interaction cross sections were included to calculate dose after penetrating layers of shielding. The emission probabilities of known nuclide source were also provided. User can input different radiation source, shielding layer, and other radiation quantities using jupyter-notebook or google colab.
